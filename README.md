## **Youtube to Mp3 converter**

This project was created out of frustration due to some Youtube online converter making **NOT ALLOWING ME EDIT THE DETAILS** once converted and download onto my computer. The codebase is crappy for now, so bear with my as I'd update the project from time to time.
Here's how the project goes;
- converter.py -> This accepts only one link for conversion to .mp3 format
- multi_converter.py -> This accepts .txt files to convert to .mp3 format, kindly check **multi_conv**
- gui-> This involves the use of GUI for the conversoin of a YouTube link to .mp3 format
    - The **.exe** should be extracted from **output.zip**, so it can be executed on your laptop as a desktop program. you could drag and drop the zipped file unto anywhere in your system and extract it there.

Enjoy and give me your feedbacks, also looking to collaborate with you all.
